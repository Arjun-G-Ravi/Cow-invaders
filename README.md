# COW INVADERS
A game where you play as a cow, and prevent monsters from getting to the barn. It is a modern recreation of atari's classic space invaders.

## The game
- Cow has to kill the monsters before it gets to the farmhouse
- The cow can either shoot or headbutt to kill the monsters
- The headbutt is a more superior way to kill (as you will realise as you play the game), but will increase the enemy spawn rate by 2 times.

### Monsters
There are three types of monsters:
1. Red Monster: They are slow in their horizontal and vertical motions. They are very common.
   
2. Pink Monster: They are very fast in their horizontal motion, but slow in the vertical one. Their initial spawn is rare.

3. White Monster: They are fast in both vertical and horizontal motions. They are extremely rare. 

## Challenge
Try to get to score: 300

## To play
Just download the repository, and run the code using python3. You must have pygame library installed. It can be installed using ```pip install pygame```.

# Future plans

### Game Based
- Cow will be able to jump to kill the enemy
- The cow will get boost from random grass appearences, which will lead to various things
- The cow will get update as the score gets higher, to control the massive enemy waves
  
### AI Based
- Automate the game with
    - Deep Reinforcement Learning
    - Proximal Policy Approximation
    - Genetic Algorithm
    - Some basic/ normal decision based algorithm (maybe)
and compare the results.
